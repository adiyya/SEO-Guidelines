# SEO-Guidelines
## <title> tags ##
  keep these clear and relevant
## <meta description> tags ##
  keep these clear and relevant, though use the added space to expand on the <title> tag in a meaningful way
## alt attributes ##
  use this attribute on <img> tags to describe the image, so that we can understand the content of the image
## <h1> tag ##
  helps users understand the content of a page more clearly when properly used
## Internal links ##
  helps create a view of how content inside your website is related.  Also helps users navigate easily to related content.
## Links to external sources ##
  be careful who you link to as it’s a signal you trust them.  The number of links pointing from your page to external locations should be reasonable.
## Social sharing ##
  enabling social sharing encourages visitors to share your content with their networks
## Crawlability ##
  ### XML Sitemaps ###
      make sure you have these set up and that you keep them fresh and current
  ### Navigational structure ###
      keep it clean, simple and easy to crawl
  ### Rich media cautions ###
      don’t bury links to content inside JavaScript
  ### Graceful degradation ###
      enable a clean down-level experience so crawlers can see your content
  ### URL structure ###
      avoid using session IDs, &, # and other characters when possible
  ### Robots.txt ###
      often placed at root of domain, be careful as its powerful; reference sitemap.xml (or your sitemap-index file) in this document
 ## Site Structure ##
  ### Links ###
      cross link liberally inside your site between relevant, related content; link to external sites as well
  ### URL structure and keyword usage ###
      keep it clean and keyword rich when possible
  ### Clean URLs ###
      no extraneous parameters (sessions, tracking, etc.)
  ### HTML & XML sitemaps ###
      enable both so users and crawlers can both find what they need – one does not replace the other
  ## General ##
    ### Head ###
      Titles – unique, relevant, 65 characters or so long.
      Descriptions – unique, relevant, grammatically correct, roughly 160 or fewer characters.
    ### Body ###
      1. H1, H2 and other H* tag usage to show content structure on page.
      2. Only one <H1> tag per page
      3. ALT tag usage – helps crawlers understand what is in an image.
      4. Keyword usage within the content/text – use the keyword/phrase you are targeting a few times; use variations as well
      5. Build based on keyword research – shows you what users are actually looking for
      6. Keep out of rich media and images – don’t use images to house your content either
      7. Produce new content frequently – crawlers respond to you posting fresh content by visiting more frequently
      8. Make it unique – don’t reuse content from other sources – critical – content must be unique in its final form on your page
      9.
