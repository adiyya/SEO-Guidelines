# SEO-Guidelines
## <title> tags ##
  keep these clear and relevant
## <meta description> tags ##
  keep these clear and relevant, though use the added space to expand on the <title> tag in a meaningful way
## alt attributes ##
  use this attribute on <img> tags to describe the image, so that we can understand the content of the image
## <h1> tag ##
  helps users understand the content of a page more clearly when properly used
## Internal links ##
  helps create a view of how content inside your website is related.  Also helps users navigate easily to related content.
## Links to external sources ##
  be careful who you link to as it’s a signal you trust them.  The number of links pointing from your page to external locations should be reasonable.
## Social sharing ##
  enabling social sharing encourages visitors to share your content with their networks
## Crawlability ##
  ### XML Sitemaps ###
      make sure you have these set up and that you keep them fresh and current
    Navigational structure
      keep it clean, simple and easy to crawl
    Rich media cautions
      don’t bury links to content inside JavaScript
    Graceful degradation
      enable a clean down-level experience so crawlers can see your content
    URL structure
      avoid using session IDs, &, # and other characters when possible
   Robots.txt
      often placed at root of domain, be careful as its powerful; reference sitemap.xml (or your sitemap-index file) in this document
 ## Site Structure ##
    Links
      cross link liberally inside your site between relevant, related content; link to external sites as well
    URL structure and keyword usage
      keep it clean and keyword rich when possible
    Clean URLs
      no extraneous parameters (sessions, tracking, etc.)
    HTML & XML sitemaps
      enable both so users and crawlers can both find what they need – one does not replace the other
